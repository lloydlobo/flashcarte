# utils

> A helper is something specific to a given project. It wouldn't generally make
> sense to share helpers between projects; the category.helpers.js functions
> really only make sense for this blog.
>>
> A utility is a generic function that accomplishes an abstract task. Pretty
> much every function in the lodash library is a utility, according to my
> definition.
